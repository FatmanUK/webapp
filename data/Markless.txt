I'm implementing a ***small!*** subset of MarkDown for my own usage. Nothing nested. Here's the test page.  

## Dashes
--- mdash  
-- ndash  
 - hyphen  

## Line breaks: double spaces.
No line break: -->
x  
Line break: -->  
x  
  
Can't do paragraphs as I don't understand the logic of placing the surrounding tags. Don't need it anyway.

## Headings: varying numbers of # symbols.
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6
###### h6 again

## Emphasis
*single asterisk*
**double asterisk**
***triple asterisk***

## Block quotes: >
> It's-a me!

Huh?  

>[Mario Mario] It's-a me!

## Code style: one tab or four spaces
	snippet 1  
  
Monospace -^ -v  
  
    snippet 2

## Footnotes
Blah blah blah [blah blah blah][This is an interesting diversion which should be edited here to keep it near the entry, but not interrupt the flow of the document when reading.] blah blah blah. Second [set of blather][A lot of nonsense].

## Lists
### Unordered: - or * or .
- item 1
- item 1
- another item 1

Separately:  
* item 1
* item 1
* another item 1

Again:
. item 1
. item 1
. another item 1

### Ordered
1. item 1
1. item 1
1. another item 1
